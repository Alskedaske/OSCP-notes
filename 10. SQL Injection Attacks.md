SQL is for relational databases: a database with tables, columns and rows.

For automatic functionality, SQL queries are often worked into the (backend) source code.

In some cases, user input is inserted directly into the SQL query. This may be abused by the user inputting snippets of SQL in such a way that data may be exposed.

To connect to an SQL instance:

```bash
mysql -u root -p'<USERNAME>' -h <TARGET_IP> -P 3306
```

You can run commands such as:
```mysql
select version();
```
```mysql
select system_user();
```

To show all databases use
```mysql
show databases;
```
