# OSCP Notes - Alskedaske

These are the notes I took while studying for the OSCP. They are separated by learning module, as well as by PG box. They also contain various elements that do not appear in the official learning material, but which may make your life and mine much easier.

The notes are not (yet) fully formatted. As such, you may come across plain IP addresses, ports, etc. which you would need to substitute for your own respective IP addresses, ports, etc.
