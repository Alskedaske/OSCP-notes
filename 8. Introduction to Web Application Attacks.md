# Web Application Assessment Tools
Nmap: use `-sV` option and use `--script "http-*"` option!
Wappalyzer: look website up on https://www.wappalyzer.com/

Gobuster: bruteforce directories. E.g.
```bash
gobuster dir -u <TARGET_IP> -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -t 10
```

## Burp Suite
Launch:
```bash
burpsuite
```
Proxy: intercept request from browser to server. Can change the request!

To configure Firefox proxy:
1. Check Burp Proxy Listeners: in Burp Suite: Proxy > Options > Proxy Listeners
2. Go to: about:preferences#general > Network Settings > Settings
3. Set the Proxy settings:
  - Manual proxy configuration
  - HTTP Proxy: Proxy IP (default: 127.0.0.1)
  - Port: Proxy Port (default: 8080)
  - Also use this proxy for HTTPS

Now we can find intercepted traffic in Burp Suite: Proxy > HTTP History

Repeater: easily make new requests/modify previous requests

To map an IP to a host:
```burp
nano /etc/hosts
```

Intruder: automate some attacks

E.g.: brute force.
1. Sign-in attempt
2. Send to Intruder
3. Go to _Positions_ subtab. Press _Clear_ to clear the fields
4. Select value of password field and press _Add_
5. Go to _Payloads_ subtab. Under _Payload Options [Simple list]_ you can add a wordlist
6. Press _Start Attack_
7. Look for anomalies: different status codes, different response lengths, etc.


# Web Application Enumeration
Try to discover the technology stack:
- Host OS
- Web server software
- Database software
- Frontend/backend programming language

Developer tools!

Discover the stack by:
- Identifying URI file extensions
- Inspecting the source code
  - Tip: "prettify" the code ({} sign at the bottom in the debugger)
  - Right click on an element and click "inspect" to inspect that element
- Inspect server responses
  - "Network" tool --> Headers/response
  - Burp
  - Watch out! Can be generated e.g. by web proxy
- Inspect sitemaps (DOMAIN/sitemap.xml, DOMAIN/robots.txt)

## Enumerating and Abusing APIs
REST API: a type of API in which the server does not have to save any information about previous requests. Every request should include all the information needed to access a URN. The server does not save a session, authentication info, etc.

APIs paths are often followed by a version number, e.g.:`/api_name/v1`

You can create a pattern for Gobuster by creating a file e.g. `pattern` with contents:
```bash
{GOBUSTER}/v1
{GOBUSTER}/v2
```

We can use Gobuster to enumerate the API:
```bash
gobuster dir -u http://192.168.50.16:5002 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt -p pattern
```

Now, we can inspect the API with curl, e.g.:
```bash
curl -i http://<TARGET_IP>/users/v1
```

We can also enumerate further on a specific API endpoint/path:
```bash
gobuster dir -u http://192.168.50.16:5002/users/v1/admin/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/small.txt
```

We can use curl to perform post requests to sign-in, e.g.:
```bash
curl -d '{"password":"fake","username":"admin"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://192.168.50.16:5002/users/v1/login
```

If we get a JWT token, we can use that too, e.g. in a PUT request to update a password:
```bash
curl -X 'PUT' \
  'http://192.168.50.16:5002/users/v1/admin/password' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: OAuth eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJleHAiOjE2NDkyNzE3OTQsImlhdCI6MTY0OTI3MTQ5NCwic3ViIjoib2Zmc2VjIn0.OeZH1rEcrZ5F0QqLb8IHbJI7f9KaRAkrywoaRUAsgA4' \
  -d '{"password": "pwned"}'
```

You can move from curl to Burp Suite by appending `--proxy 127.0.0.1:8080` to the curl command. This makes it easier.

```bash

```
```bash

```
```bash

```
```bash

```
```bash

```
