# Vulnerability Scanning Theory

Can help establish baseline on the network before more thorough manual testing.

Basic process:
1. Host discovery
2. Port scanning
3. Operating system, service, and version detection
4. Matching the results to a vulnerability database

Types of vulnerability scans:
1. Internal
   - Usually VPN access. Sometimes on-site.
3. External
4. Unauthenticated
5. Authenticated

Key considerations that may need to be reflected in scan configurations:
1. Scanning duration
2. Target visibility: some targets may not be reachable due to firewalls/VPNs/etc. Also: presence of IPS, routers, etc. may influence this for an interal scan.
3. Rate limiting
4. Network and system impact of scan
